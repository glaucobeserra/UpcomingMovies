# Upcoming Movies
## Mobile Dev Code Challenge - iOS

### Installation
Upcoming Movies iOS App was developed with swift 4.x and is compatible with Xcode 9.3+.

### Get Started
Open the file "UpcomingMovies.xcworkspace" and press (command) âŒ˜ + R to run the project.

### Coding Explanation
To manage the requests, I chose to create my own network layer. I decided to use Kingfisher to improve performance, help manage and download images from URL and cache it. And finally, despite the little experience with this design pattern I tried to implement MVVM to my project by understanding the benefits it provides mainly in regards to scalability and testability.

### Todos

 - Load launch screen
 - Implement the movie search function
 - And that's just the beginning
